Learn how to deploy an app to PyPi (the Python Package Index) so you can do `pip install <your-app>`. 

Live App: https://github.com/srvup/srvup-comments `pip install srvup-comments`

Django guide: https://kirr.co/1yt5cz 

Python guide: https://kirr.co/ughb52

This one picks up from where joincfe.com/projects/django-comments/ left off but you don't have to watch that one to make this one.  Probably for more advanced Python/Django users :).
