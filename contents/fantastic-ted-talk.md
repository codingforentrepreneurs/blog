This is by far one of the most important ted talks I've seen in a while.

I think about my own journey into becoming a software developer and where I started with literally 0 skill in the area and how I am/was dedicated to mastery. Not long ago, I thought I would just "never be a software developer" because I just simply wasn't committed to becoming proficient in coding and I really didn't believe it was possible for me.

Then, after years of kind of wanting it, I realized something else: the power of regret. Regret, or rather, having regrets is one of the driving forces in my life since I only get one shot at this thing we call life. 

I knew for years that I would regret not acquiring the skill of controlling computers (what computer programming is/does) especially as my coding co-founder left a business which I thought, at the time, was going to change the restaurant industry around the world. 

I am super competitive so the idea of failing at yet another business was too painful. So I decided to do everything in my power to learn how to code.

It took months. That's it. Months. At that point I had been in classrooms for years and I was afraid of dedicating months? Pretty much. It's sad but it's truth; I was afraid.

Now when I say months, I mean I could build a very basic web application from scratch with practically 0 help from others. This was incredibly motivating to me and pushed me further down the rabbit hole of the world of programming.

I redesigned my old business's web software from scratch. It was not a great product so I did it again. And again. And again.

Then I realized something else: learning to control computers is far more important than shifting one single industry. Computers can and will shift every industry again and again and again. It's something I had to be a part of.

That's also when I realized my journey to becoming a proficient coder wasn't actually all that difficult. Sure I still had a long way to go to become a master (ahem I still feel that way over 6 years later), but I knew that I had enough skills to be able to build confidence and momentum with others.

And so, [Coding for Entrepreneurs](http://join CFE.com/) was born and my life has been drastically altered ever since. 

I'm lucky enough to be raised by parents who believed in me and helped me realize that I am in control of how hard I work and how I will choose to persevere. In other words, they helped me believe in myself and my choices.

I believe you can persevere to learn any skill, but only if you choose to work for it. Mastery just takes grit and perseverance and time. 

Cheers,
