In our [Machine Learning](/courses/machine-learning) (ML) course, we discuss the importance of `good data in, good data out` and this post is meant to be a long-term reference of finding quality datasets. 

This is certainly not exhaustive but if you have found datasets that we are missing, please comment below.

### Datasets Repos
- [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com) ([http://www.kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com)) has a lot of datasets as well as competitions for various ML/AI projects.
- [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/) (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/). The University of California at Irvine has published all kinds of great datasets for data scientists to use.

### Building Datasets
In the long run, we'll likely build our own datasets for problems that have yet to be solved or attempted. In that case, it's a really good idea to learn how to do [web scraping](/courses/web-scraping/) as well as learning how to work with [numpy](/tags/numpy) ([docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/)) and [pandas](/tags/pandas/) ([docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)).
