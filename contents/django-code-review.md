We want to help solve problems that you're having on your code. So we're trying out something new: Django Code Review. 

Here's how you can get your code reviewed (please note we pick at random):
1. Be a subscriber ([joincfe.com/youtube](http://joincfe.com/youtube))
2. Leave a comment on the most recent Django Code Review Video (playlist: [https://kirr.co/1jeua2](https://kirr.co/1jeua2))
3. Comment with a link your Django code on Github (learn to upload your code: [https://youtu.be/dlz6Qyp4ADE](https://youtu.be/dlz6Qyp4ADE))

I'm looking forward to reviewing as much of your code as possible!

Cheers,

Justin
