So I picked myself up a [GeForce GTX 1080 Ti](http://amzn.to/2DUvLXa) to use with Tensorflow for some deep learning on my *Windows 10* machine.

I hoped the installation process would be as simple as:

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

Although it was *close* to that, there are still several other, mildly frustrating, steps you must take to get Nvidia GPU fully working. I'll say that once you get it working, training deep learning models is on orders of magnitude faster!

### Guide Overview

1. Install Nvidia's card on your computer along with drivers

2. Download & Install CUDA

3. Download & "Install" cuDNN

4. Uninstall Tensorflow, Install Tensorflow GPU

5. Update the `%PATH%` on the system

5. Verify installation


### Requirements

- NVIDA Graphics Card (Probably a 1050 & up); I'm using a 1080Ti

- Windows 10 (recommended; older versions *might* work)


## A word of caution: VERSIONS WILL CHANGE

As of this writing, CUDA 9.1 is out. Tensorflow's GPU supports **CUDA 8** and ***not*** CUDA 9. Well, as far as their Windows [install docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows#requirements_to_run_tensorflow_with_gpu_support) state:

> Requirements to run TensorFlow with GPU support
If you are installing TensorFlow with GPU support using one of the mechanisms described in this guide, then the following NVIDIA software must be installed on your system:

>> CUDAÂ® Toolkit 8.0. For details, see NVIDIA's documentation Ensure that you append the relevant Cuda pathnames to the %PATH% environment variable as described in the NVIDIA documentation.

>> The NVIDIA drivers associated with CUDA Toolkit 8.0.
cuDNN v6.0. For details, see NVIDIA's documentation. Note that cuDNN is typically installed in a different location from the other CUDA DLLs. Ensure that you add the directory where you installed the cuDNN DLL to your %PATH% environment variable.

>> GPU card with CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 or higher. See NVIDIA documentation for a list of supported GPU cards.

> If you have a different version of one of the preceding packages, please change to the specified versions. In particular, the cuDNN version must match exactly: TensorFlow will not load if it cannot find cuDNN64_6.dll. To use a different version of cuDNN, you must build from source.


## Let's get started

### 1. Install Nvidia Graphics Card & Drivers

Let us know in the comments if you need help here.

### 2. Download & Install CUDA
CUDA has different versions. We need CUDA Version 8.0. I have 8.0, 9.0, and 9.1 installed and setup identically to this guide for each version. Stick with 8.0 for now to get that working. I setup the other versions to prepare for the possiblity of Tensorflow GPU supporting other CUDA versions.

1. Go to [CUDA Toolkit downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
2. Scroll down to **Legacy Releases** or [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
3.  Click on the version you want *CUDA Toolkit X.Y*:
	- for 8.0, we'll see *CUDA Toolkit 8.0 GA<Z>* so replace `*<Z>*` with the highest number available. I downloaded `CUDA Toolkit 8.0 GA2`
	- for 9.0, the file is *CUDA Toolkit 9.0*
	- for 9.1, the file is *CUDA Toolkit 9.1*:

4. Select your operating system, mine is:
	- OS: Windows
	- Architecture: x86_64
	- Version: 10
5. After CUDA downloads, run the file downloaded & install with `Express Settings`. This might take a while and flicker the screen (due to it being for the graphics card and all).
6. Verify
You should know have the following path on your system:
```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0
```


### 3. Download & "Install" cuDNN
For this, you'll need an NVIDIA developer account. It's free. 

1. Create a free NVIDIA Developer Membership [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/developer-program/signup)
2. After you sign up go to: [https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
3. Click "Download" (ignore the current listed version for now)
4. Agree to the Terms
5. Remember how above we need `cuDNN v6.0` from above? You might see this listed here, you might not. If you don't, just select **Archived cuDNN Releases**
6. Click the version you need as well as the system you need. I clicked:
	- `Download cuDNN v6.0 (April 27, 2017), for CUDA 8.0`
	- then, `cuDNN v6.0 Library for Windows 10`
7. Go to your recent downloaded zip file, something like:
```
C:\Users\teamcfe\Downloads\cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v6.0.zip
```
8. Unzip the file
9. Open "cuda", you should see:
```
bin/
include/
lib/
```

10. Copy and paste the 3 folders in `C:\Users\j\Downloads\cudnn-8.0-windows10-x64-v6.0.zip\cuda` to `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0`
> Do note that dragging and dropping will merge the folders and not replace them; I don't believe the same is true for Mac/Linux. If it asks you to *replace* anything, say no and just drag and drop each folder's contents from cuDNN to Cuda. It might as about admin privileges which you should just say yes.

11. Verify
If you did the last step correctly, you should be able to find this path:
```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\lib\x64\cudnn.lib
```


### 4. Uninstall Tensorflow, Install Tensorflow GPU
Remove tensorflow from your system if it's currently installed with:
```
pip uninstall tensorflow
```
Because we want to use tensorflow with GPU support. It's easy just do:
```
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
I'm glad that was easy :)

### 5. Update the `%PATH%` on the system
Update your **system** environment variables' `PATH` to have:

- `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin`
- `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\libnvvp`

To get here, do a start menu/cortana search for `Edit the system environment variables`
- It should open `System Properties` and the `Advanced` tab.
- Click 'Environment Variables'
- Under `System Variables` look for `PATH`, click `edit`
- Add the 2 lines from above

### 6. Verify installation.

There are two python scripts you can use:

##### Verify GPU & Tensorflow -- Option 1 -- without suggestions
```
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
print(device_lib.list_local_devices())

```
In that print statement you should see something like:
```
[name: "/device:CPU:0"
device_type: "CPU"
memory_limit: 268435456
locality {
}
incarnation: 3790989966624548110
, name: "/device:GPU:0"
device_type: "GPU"
memory_limit: 9226016523
locality {
  bus_id: 1
}
incarnation: 14277882179479335037
physical_device_desc: "device: 0, name: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, pci bus id: 0000:01:00.0, compute capability: 6.1"
]
```

##### Verify GPU & Tensorflow -- Option 2 -- with suggestions

### Final note

I have CUDA 8.0, 9.0, and 9.1 installed with the corresponding cuDNN in each version. The cuDNN installation process is the *exact* same for each version of CUDA except you might need a different version of cuDNN depending on the suggestions given from option 2 in step 6.
