It's fitting that the first blog post of 2016 shows that the term `Learn Python` has overtaken the term `Learn Java` in late 2015 on [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=learn%20python%2C%20learn%20java%2C%20learn%20ios%2C%20learn%20javascript&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B8). 

I see this as telling a different story then just the numbers. I see it as a trend of users looking for a robust programming language that works on many platforms. 

Python is supported across web, mobile, servers, desktop, IoT  (internet of Things), data science, data visualization, search engines (Google), launching rockets (SpaceX), animation (Pixar), and much more. 

Needless to say, it's a pretty exciting time to be a member of the Python community. 

What do you think? Can Python overtake Java for good?
