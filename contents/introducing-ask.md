At CFE, our fundamental goal is to help students launch projects faster. To support this goal, we are proud to be releasing <a href='http://joincfe.com/ask/'>Ask</a> today. 

<a href='http://joincfe.com/ask/'>Ask</a> is a community-powered place to get your questions answered. 

<a href='http://joincfe.com/ask/'>Ask</a> came out of the need to provide our students with a more robust way to ask questions and get answers outside of the context of any given video. Sometimes the questions are related to code directly, sometimes it's something more abstract. <a href='http://joincfe.com/ask/'>Ask</a> is also viewed as an experimental way of collaborative learning. 

Over time, our knowledge base will grow and ideally become a powerful resource of finding answers to questions ranging from common to more obscure.
