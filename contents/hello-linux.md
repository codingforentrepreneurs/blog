`git push live master`

This is our goal. We want to be able to deploy our apps just by pushing some code. This series will show you how, step-by-step, with your own production server.

You can use this to:
- Deploy Django, Flask, or any other Python Web Application
- Run Machine Learning in Production
- Run Microsevices or Processing-heavy tasks to offload workload to a smaller, dedicated server
- Rapidly develop new scalable projects


 [Hello Linux](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/hello-linux) is truly a series about helping you better understand many of the technologies behind what makes Django, Flask, and many other web frameworks run in production.

In __Hello Linux__, we will implement the following:

1. __Git__ for pushing, building, & deploying ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/git-push-local-code-to-live-linux-server/))

2. __Virtualenv__ for maintaining consistent python packages in our project ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/hello-linux-virtual-environment-working-directory/))

3. __PostgreSQL__ as our database ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/hello-linux-postgresql-on-live-linux-server))

4. __Gunicorn__ as our WSGI web server ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/hello-linux-setup-gunicorn-and-supervisor))

5. __Supervisor__ for managing processes ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/hello-linux-setup-gunicorn-and-supervisor))

6. __Nginx__ as our web server ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/hello-linux-nginx-and-ufw-firewall))

7. __Redis__ for our task queue datastore / message broker ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/hello-linux-install-redis))

8. __Celery__ as our Python app task queue / scheduler ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/hello-linux-celery-supervisor))

9. __Django__ as our Python web framework (full push update, etc)

10. __Let's Encrypt__ for HTTPs Certificates ([Guide](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/custom-domain-and-https-with-lets-encrypt))
